  <p>By Valeria Coll</p>

<div id="caption">
  <p> Within the next two charts is insightful information about the ownership of health insurance among different individuals in the United States in 2018 and 2019. In the first chart you will learn about how health insurance is distributed among people of different races and hispanic origin. In the second chart, you will learn about the amount of uninsured people according to each state in the US. This data is important to help people understand differences and potential inequalities between varying demographic groups and geographical areas. This data can be used by policy makers to get a better understanding of the country's population and where certain opportunities or funding may be lacking in terms of health and wellness. </p>
